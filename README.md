## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A local or remote HTTP server (for local development, [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for VSCode is recommended)

### Installation

**Note:** React wasn't chosen in an attempt to make it easy to make a WebView of it on Android.

1. **Clone or download this repository.**
2. **Ensure the following structure:**
    ```
    <project_folder>/
      www/
        css/
          index.css

    package-lock.json
    ```
3. **Start a local server** in the `www` directory.

### Android Compiling Instructions:

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `cordova build android`
3. Your `.apk` will be in `platforms\android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk` directory/file.

## Customization

- **Kanji Data:** Edit or expand `db/N5.json` to add or modify kanji and examples.
- **Styling:** Modify `css/index.css` for appearance tweaks. (it's a bit of a mess right now)

  "JLPTLevel": 5, --> Use 0 for Kana

## DISCLAIMER

AI was heavily used for the development of this project.
**HOWEVER**, exhaustive human oversight was involved in the coding, designing and decision making of the entirety of it. **IT IS NOT 100% AI NOR WOULD AI ALONE GET YOU THIS FAR!**

## Credits

The idea is inspired from http://www.studykanji.net, however, as there is no portable version for Android systems nor can it be used offline, there was a necessity to create a similar project. The kanji readings (namely the JSON) comes mostly from their site.

**No development to closely resemble ALL or MOST of their features will be done.** This is purely a barebones flashcard version.
